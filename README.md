## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Using a `<s>` or `<del>` tag doesn't necessarily announce to screen reader users that the element has been deleted or is no longer relevant. I added an `aria-label` to remedy this, but not sure if this is the best way to indicate the old price to users of assistive technology.
